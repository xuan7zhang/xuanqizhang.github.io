I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia, supervised by  
<a href="https://tea.ece.ubc.ca/">Prof. Xiaoxiao Li</a>.  
My research interests broadly include efficient machine learning models and algorithms.  
I am always open to collaboration. Feel free to drop me an e-mail.
